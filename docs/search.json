    "section": "",
    "text": "Welcome video\n\n\n\n\nIntroduction\nFor this activity, you will be exploring the result times from female and male runners that finished the 2023 Boston Marathon.\nIn particular, you will examine both visualizations and summary statistics of result times to explore the variation in finish times as well as use comparative techniques, such as z-scores, to compare and contrast male and female participants.\nInvestigating these trends is useful for several reasons. Firstly, exploring these trends can help to deepen our understanding of how different factors, such as gender, impact marathon performances. Secondly, analyzing the distribution of finish times and the performance of top finishers against the masses provides insights into the competitive landscape of the marathon. It can identify outliers or exceptional performances and understand how elite athletes compare to average participants. Although not directly connected to this data, analyses like these can inform training strategies, highlight the effectiveness of different preparation methods, and inspire both new and experienced runners by showcasing the range of achievable performances.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nActivity Length\n\n\n\n\n\nThis activity would be suitable for an in-class example or quiz.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLearning Objectives\n\n\n\n\n\nBy the end of the activity, you will be able to:\n\nAnalyze distributions using histograms\nIdentify potential confounding variables to explain bimodal data\nCompare and contrast distributions for a pair of groups\nCalculate and compare z-scores for individual cases\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMethods\n\n\n\n\n\nFor this activity, students will primarily use basic concepts of histograms and summary statistics to analyze distributions. Students will also likely require knowledge of z-scores.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTechnology Requiremens\n\n\n\n\n\nThe provided worksheets do not require any specific statistical software. (Although they will likely require access to a calculator.)\nSince the data are provided, instructors are encouraged to modify the worksheets to have student construct visualizations and calculate summary statistics using whichever software they choose.\n\n\n\n\n\nData\nThe data set contains 26598 rows and 15 columns. Each row represents a runner who completed the Boston Marathon in 2023\nDownload data:\nAvailable on the SCORE Data Repository: boston_marathon_2023.csv\n\n\nVariable Descriptions\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVariable\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nage_group\nage group of the runner\n\n\nplace_overall\nfinishing place of the runner out of all runners\n\n\nplace_gender\nfinishing place of runner among the same gender\n\n\nplace_division\nfinishing place of runner among runners of the same gender and age group\n\n\nname\nname of runner\n\n\ngender\ngender of runner\n\n\nteam\nteam the runner is affiliated with\n\n\nbib_number\nbib number of runner\n\n\nhalf_time\nhalf marathon time of runner\n\n\nfinish_net\nfinishing time timed from when they cross the starting gate\n\n\nfinish_gun\nfinishing time of runner timed from when the starter gun is fired\n\n\nhalf_time_sec\nhalf marathon time in seconds\n\n\nfinish_net_sec\nnet finish in seconds\n\n\nfinish_gun_sec\ngun finish in seconds\n\n\nfinish_net_minutes\nnet finish in minutes\n\n\n\nData Source\nBoston Athletic Association\n\n\n\nMaterials\n\nWe provide editable MS Word handouts along with their solutions.\n\nClass handout\n\n\nClass handout - with solutions\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConclusion\n\n\n\n\n\nIn conclusion, the Boston Marathon Times worksheet provides valuable learning opportunities for students in several key areas. It allows them to understand reasons by variability might exist and to discover multimodal distributions can occur simply due to excluding an important explanatory variable that otherwise confounds the analysis. The calculation of z-scores or other similar measurement of relative location enables students to compare and contrast the remarkable achievements of the top female and male finishers, shedding light on their talent in their respective fields. Overall, this worksheet allows students to critically analyze the 2023 marathon result data and draw meaningful conclusions about the extraordinary performances of athletes in the race.",

    "section": "",
    "text": "Welcome video\n\n\n\n\nIntroduction\nLeague of Legends (LoL) is a 5 v. 5 multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) game developed by Riot Games. In this game, players assume the role of a “champion” with unique abilities and engage in intense battles against a team of other players or computer-controlled champions. Riot Games continually collects data to evaluate the impact of each champion, adjusting and fine-tuning various aspects to ensure fair and competitive gameplay. With regular updates (patches) occurring every two weeks, champions can become either extremely efficient and strong or in need of adjustments to enhance their abilities. Maintaining overall game balance is crucial, and developers employ strategies known as “nerfing” and “buffing” to achieve this balance. “Nerfing” refers to reducing the power or effectiveness of a champion or item, while “buffing” involves increasing its power or effectiveness.\nIn this worksheet, we will analyze and describe histograms of Win Rates for different champions in LoL. The Win Rate, a key metric in the game, represents the percentage of games won by a champion out of the total games played. Understanding the distribution of Win Rates and identifying potential outliers can provide valuable insights into champion balance and performance, informing strategic decision-making in LoL gameplay.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLearning Objectives\n\n\n\n\n\nBy the end of this activity, you will be able to:\n\nUnderstand the concept of histograms and their relevance in statistical analysis.\nAnalyze and describe histograms to gain insights into the distribution of Win Rates in League of Legends. In particular, being able to describe the center, shape, and spread of a distribution based on the displayed graph.\nIdentify potential outliers in a numerical variable using numerical methods such as the “1.5 IQR Rule” or z-scores.\nInterpret the implications of outliers in terms of champion balance and performance.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMethods\n\n\n\n\n\nTechnology requirement: The activity handout provides histograms and summary statistics so that no statistical software is required. However, the activity could be modified to ask students to produce that information from the raw dataset and/or extend the activity to investigate other variables available in the data.\n\nHistograms: Familiarity with histograms as a graphical representation of the distribution of a continuous variable, such as Win Rates, is crucial. You should understand how to interpret histograms, including the concepts of bins, frequencies, and the shape, center, and spread of distributions.\nOutliers: Knowledge of outliers, which are data points that deviate significantly from the overall pattern, is important.\nFamiliarity with basic statistical analysis techniques, such as measures of central tendency (mean, median) and measures of dispersion (standard deviation, range), will aid in interpreting and analyzing the histograms. These techniques can provide insights into the overall characteristics and variability of the Win Rates.\nKnowledge of outlier detection methods (such as the 1.5 IQR Rule and/or z-scores) is fundamental to the activity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nData\nA data frame for 162 champions of the following 7 variables. Each row represents a Champion that you can choose when playing League of Legends during patches 12.22 and 12.23. Note that the activity provided in this module does not use all of the variables provided. Instead they are provided for further analyses at the discretion of the user.\nAvailable on the SCORE Data Repository\nDownload data: LOL_patch_12.22.csv\nDownload data: LOL_patch_12.23.csv\n\n\nVariable Descriptions\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVariable\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nName\nname of the champion\n\n\nRole\nrole of the champion in a game\n\n\nKDA\nAverage kills, deaths and assists associated with each champion\n\n\nWRate\nwin rates of each champion\n\n\nPickRate\npick rates of each champion\n\n\nRolePerc\npercentage of time playing as a role\n\n\nBanPerc\nban percentages associated with each champion\n\n\n\n\n\nData Source\nLol champion stats, 12.22 master, win rates.

One notable finding from this worksheet is the identification of Sion as a low outlier in the Win Rates for the 12.22 patch. However, in the subsequent 12.23 patch, Sion’s Win Rate improved, and was no longer an outlier. Sion was given a Buff in patch 12.23, resulting in an enhanced performance and a more balanced Win Rate. However, patch 12.23 resulted in two new outliers with low win rates.\nThe continued presence of outliers highlights the importance of continuous monitoring and adjustments by game developers to ensure fair and competitive gameplay.",
